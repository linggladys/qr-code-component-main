Browser used: Firefox

### Links

- Live Site URL: (https://qr-code-component-main-iota-peach.vercel.app/)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS
- Simple flexbox property
- My hands
- Constant Googling


### What I learned
This is my first time participating in FrontEnd Mentor. I guess there's none much to learn (other than being able to solve the issue in which the footer has to stick all the way below in mobile phones). I look forward to participate when I am ready.

### Continued development
I hope I can build it using TailWind CSS.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25241593/sticky-footer-not-totaly-in-the-bottom-on-a-mobile-device) - The `position:absolute` helped me solve the issue I mentioned in What I learned section.
